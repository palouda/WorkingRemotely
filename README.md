Motivation:
This is an exercise in basic data analysis using a single dataset. Specifically, this looks at working remotely and the effects of that on salary, job satisfaction, etc.

Results:
The only reliable information that can be drawn from the analysis is that the more experience that you have, the more likely it is that you will be able to work remotely.
